# Voice Medication Assistant with Murf Falcon & ASR

This is a voice-driven application that:
- Lets users speak or spell a medicine name and get spoken info about its use
- Allows users to set voice-based reminders (e.g., for medicine or meetings)
- Responds in real time using Murf Falcon Text-to-Speech
- Uses Deepgram for speech-to-text transcription
